# Combat-Corona
A web project based on a solution for COVID-19 Pandemic, with an idea that focuses on organizing people into a network  to keep record if virus enters a particular social network/ community( Project is in its initial stages )

The main idea behind the project is even during lockdown, we may come in contact with certain people, like neighbours, househelpers, etc. and they may be possible carriers of the virus. Now, we can consider our social networks to be just like a Multi-Siblng Graph( more specifically a B+ Tree without a restriction on 'm' ), just to give a more mathematical approach to our problem.
And we can use unique Identification numbers of users, say Aadhar Number, and form such graphs based on data collected from them and keep record of all positie cases in the nation. And modify each place of a positive case in the graph such that all those who fall in his network,directly or indirectly, get a warning that they are vulnerable.
