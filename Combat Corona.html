    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is to provide its users with a tool through which they can stay constantly updated about the status of coronavirus patients
      specifically in their community or network, and also to warn them against the same as soon as there is an instance of a case that could travel through
      their network and ultimately reach them and also tell the <strong>degree of vulnerability they currently face.</strong>
    </p>

  <div class="idea" id="idea" data-aos="fade-left">

    <h2>Idea Behind the Project</h2>
    <p>
      The idea here is that our social relations can actually be considered just as a network or a graph which would give a much more mathematical and
      scientific approach towards the problem. Next the web tool will <strong>organize its users into a social network</strong>, according to certain information that will be
      collected from them. And based upon that, certain algorithm will be implemented on this data and the data from the government regarding the positive
      cases of the disease to tell the users how vulnerable they currently are, <strong>what is the level of penetration of the disease in their network, specifically;</strong>
      and also advise them to socially distance from the people they know who may turn out to be potential carriers of the virus.
